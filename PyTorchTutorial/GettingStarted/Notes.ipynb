    "### How autograd encodes the history\n",
    "Autograd is reverse automatic differentiation system. Conceptually, autograd records a graph recording all of the operations that created the data as you execute operations, giving you a directed acyclic graph whose leaves are the input tensors and roots are the output tensors. By tracing this graph from roots to leaves, you can automatically compute the gradients using the chain rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, autograd represents this graph as a graph of Function objects (really expressions), which can be apply() ed to compute the result of evaluating the graph. When computing the forwards pass, autograd simultaneously performs the requested computations and builds up a graph representing the function that computes the gradient (the .grad_fn attribute of each torch.Tensor is an entry point into this graph). When the forwards pass is completed, we evaluate this graph in the backwards pass to compute the gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to note is that the graph is recreated from scratch at every iteration, and this is exactly what allows for using arbitrary Python control flow statements, that can change the overall shape and size of the graph at every iteration. You don’t have to encode all possible paths before you launch the training - what you run is what you differentiate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In-place operations with autograd\n",
    "Supporting in-place operations in autograd is a hard matter, and we discourage their use in most cases. Autograd’s aggressive buffer freeing and reuse makes it very efficient and there are very few occasions when in-place operations actually lower memory usage by any significant amount. Unless you’re operating under heavy memory pressure, you might never need to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main reasons that limit the applicability of in-place operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In-place operations can potentially overwrite values required to compute gradients.\n",
    "2. Every in-place operation actually requires the implementation to rewrite the computational graph. Out-of-place versions simply allocate new objects and keep references to the old graph, while in-place operations, require changing the creator of all inputs to the Function representing this operation. This can be tricky, especially if there are many Tensors that reference the same storage (e.g. created by indexing or transposing), and in-place functions will actually raise an error if the storage of modified inputs is referenced by any other Tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In-place correctness checks\n",
    "Every tensor keeps a version counter, that is incremented every time it is marked dirty in any operation. When a Function saves any tensors for backward, a version counter of their containing Tensor is saved as well. Once you access self.saved_tensors it is checked, and if it is greater than the saved value an error is raised. This ensures that if you’re using in-place functions and not seeing any errors, you can be sure that the computed gradients are correct."

    "By default, GPU operations are asynchronous. When you call a function that uses the GPU, the operations are enqueued to the particular device, but not necessarily executed until later. This allows us to execute more computations in parallel, including operations on CPU or other GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the effect of asynchronous computation is invisible to the caller, because (1) each device executes operations in the order they are queued, and (2) PyTorch automatically performs necessary synchronization when copying data between CPU and GPU or between two GPUs. Hence, computation will proceed as if every operation was executed synchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can force synchronous computation by setting environment variable CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1. This can be handy when an error occurs on the GPU. (With asynchronous execution, such an error isn’t reported until after the operation is actually executed, so the stack trace does not show where it was requested.)\n",

    "A CUDA stream is a linear sequence of execution that belongs to a specific device. You normally do not need to create one explicitly: by default, each device uses its own “default” stream.\n",

    "PyTorch uses a caching memory allocator to speed up memory allocations. This allows fast memory deallocation without device synchronizations. However, the unused memory managed by the allocator will still show as if used in nvidia-smi. You can use memory_allocated() and max_memory_allocated() to monitor memory occupied by tensors, and use memory_cached() and max_memory_cached() to monitor memory managed by the caching allocator. Calling empty_cache() releases all unused cached memory from PyTorch so that those can be used by other GPU applications.

A common pattern is to use Python’s argparse module to read in user arguments, and have a flag that can be used to disable CUDA, in combination with is_available().

Note that this logic won’t traverse lists/dicts/any other data structures and will only consider Tensor s that are direct arguments to the call. You can return either a single Tensor output, or a tuple of Tensor s if there are multiple outputs. Also, please refer to the docs of Function to find descriptions of useful methods that can be called only from forward().\n",

If your inputs didn’t require gradient (needs_input_grad is a tuple of booleans indicating whether each input needs gradient computation), or were non-Tensor objects, you can return None.
